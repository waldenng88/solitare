This is a take on the classic game of solitare. The game starts off with 7 columns of 7 cards and three cards in a reserve pile. In the 3 rightmost columns the 3 highest (furthest away from the player) cards are turned over. Instead of matching cards to the opposite color, the player is only allowed to match cards to a matching suit. The rules for moving cards is that the pile that the player takes can come from anywhere, but when they take the pile the must take it with every card under it. From there, the top card has to be matching suit and one less than the last card in a pile and that is where it goes. The reserve pile is for when the user is out of moves and that is the only time where they can be activiated. Kings are the only card that can be moved into an empty column (starter). The goal of the game is to finish with 4 piles going from King to Ace in each of the 4 suits
